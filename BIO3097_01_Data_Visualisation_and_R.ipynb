        "Understanding when to use different data visualisations is a major skill for presenting scientific findings and analyses. Prof. Claus Wilke has released an excellent and free online book called [**Fundamentals of Data Visualisation**](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). In this book, he describes the best way of visualising different data types and what to avoid. It is platform agnostic and applies whether you are making plots in R, Excel, Graph Pad or python. Use this as your default reference when thinking about how to visualise your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hadley Wickham's R for data science.\n",
        "Hadley Wickham is the author of R packages `ggplot` and `tidyverse` which we will use extensively in this session. He has also produced a free online book that outlines many cool tricks you can do with these packages. We will explore a mere handful in this session, but they may prove useful in your project analyses. You can find his book [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Practical ggplot for data visualisation.\n",
        "Combining these two things, Claus Wilke has [written a resource](https://github.com/clauswilke/practical_ggplot2) with practical examples of how to best use R to make your figures. Much of the code we will go through here is taken from this resource, so it's definitely worth checking out.\n",
